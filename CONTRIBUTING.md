# Contributing notes

## Reporting an issue

After ensuring the problem was not reported already, any issue may be created using [this page][issues].

## Development guidelines

### Starting point

- The `master` branch is a snapshot of the latest stable release. It is not intended to receive any commit/pull request
directly.
- A dedicated branch must always be created for any modification, starting from a relevant non-`master` branch. For
instance, fixing an issue in release `1.0.0` shall be done by creating a dedicated branch from the `1.0` branch.
- A dedicated branch shall be named `feature/<my-feature>` or `fix/<my-issue>`.

### Modifying source code

- Apart from your preferred IDE, no other tools is required.
- Use the integrated Gradle Wrapper executable `gradlew` to execute development tasks.
- All packages, classes, methods must have a relevant documentation. A relevant documentation provides all information
to identify the responsibility and behaviour of the class/method, such as developers don't have to inspect the code to
understand how to use it.
- Prefer adding relevant documentation directly in the code instead of creating an implementation document, to guarantee
accessibility for developers.
- Unit tests must be written for all classes. Code coverage with unit tests shall be the highest possible, to avoid
unknown behaviours at execution, and improve software reliability.
- Functional tests may be written, though not mandatory. 

### Executing functional tests from an IDE

When working with an IDE, it may be useful to run tests regularly. The IDE and Gradle may have different compilation
output paths. When executing functional tests (located in the `org.siouan.frontendgradleplugin.functional` package),
concrete Gradle builds are executed, and are based on Gradle's compilation output path. This path contains classes
compiled during a Gradle build, not an IDE build. Therefore, to avoid executing tests on obsolete code, it is mandatory
to execute the Gradle task `pluginUnderTestMetata` before running functional tests.

```sh
gradlew pluginUnderTestMetadata

```

### Committing

- Ideally, a feature/fix shall be provided in a single commit. Use of commit amend may be useful.
- If a commit fixes an issue, either a feature, a bug or a documentation task, provide the message
'Fixed #<issue_number>'.
- The automated test suite must be run and no test case must fail before any commit.

### Pull request

- If a particular design/implementation must be explained to deal with the request, provide additional notes directly in
the request.
